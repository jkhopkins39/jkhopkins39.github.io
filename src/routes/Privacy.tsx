          Hoppy Tech LLC (&ldquo;Hoppy Tech,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;our&rdquo;) provides web development and AI solutions. This Privacy
          Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you

        <p>
          We collect information you choose to share when reaching out about a
          project. That typically includes:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>Phone number</li>
          <li>
            Optional details you provide in a message, quote form, or referral
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information may come through our website contact or quote forms,
          or through <strong className="text-ink font-medium">Google Ads lead forms</strong>.
          We use those forms strictly for business inquiries and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use our website chat assistant, we collect the messages you send
          so the assistant can respond, and we keep a transcript of the
          conversation (linked to an anonymous session ID, not your identity) to
          improve responses and follow up on inquiries raised through chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use our referral form, we collect your name and email, along
          with the name and contact details of the business you refer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you submit a form, we also record your{" "}
          <strong className="text-ink font-medium">IP address</strong>, browser
          user agent, referring page, and the approximate city or region derived
          from that IP. We keep this alongside the submission to prevent spam and
          abuse, and to have a record of where an inquiry came from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contact-form submissions are screened automatically before they reach
          our inbox. This involves a basic validity check of the email address
          and phone number you provide, and passing the message through an{" "}
          <strong className="text-ink font-medium">AI model (Google Gemini)</strong>{" "}
          that classifies it as a genuine inquiry or as spam. Submissions
          identified as spam are not delivered. If yours is screened out in
          error, email us directly and it will be read.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also collect limited technical data (such as pages visited and
          approximate device or browser information) through analytics and
          advertising tools described below.
        </p>

            submissions for spam and abuse
          </li>
          <li>
            Measure advertising performance (for example, whether a Google Ads
            lead or call resulted in contact)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not use your contact details for unrelated marketing lists or
          spam.

          process data only as needed to provide their services to us.

          We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our
          rights, safety, or property.

          email, and phone number and shares them with us so we can follow up on
          your inquiry. We treat that information the same as contact details
          submitted on our website — for business communication only.

          We also use Google Ads and Google Analytics tags, and{" "}
          <strong className="text-ink font-medium">Vercel Analytics</strong>, to
          understand how visitors find and use our site, and to measure
          conversions (such as form submissions or click-to-call). Meta Pixel
          may be used for similar advertising measurement.

          in the normal course of operations.
